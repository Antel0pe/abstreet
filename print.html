<p>A/B Street builds a rich representation of a city map using OpenStreetMap (OSM) and other sources. This chapter describes how.</p>
<p>TODO: Integrate pictures from
<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cF7qFtjAzkXL_r62CjxBvgQnLvuQ9I2WTE2iX_5tMCY/edit?usp=sharing">these slides</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/chYd5I-5oyc?t=439">This recorded presentation</a> covers some of
this.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-map" id="the-map">The map</a></h2>
<p>A single city is broken down into different pieces...</p>
<p>A/B Street comes with a few maps, each defined by a bounding/clipping polygon
for some portion of Seattle. Each map has these objects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Roads</strong>: A single road connects two intersections, carrying OSM metadata and
containing some child lanes.</li>
<li><strong>Lanes</strong>: An individual lane of traffic. Driving (any vehicle), bus-only, and
bike-only lanes have a direction. On-street parking lanes don't allow any
movement, and they have some number of parking spots. Sidewalks are
bidirectional.</li>
<li><strong>Intersections</strong>: An intersection has references to all of the incoming and
outgoing lanes. Most intersections have a stop sign or traffic signal policy
controlling movement through it.
<ul>
<li><strong>Border</strong> intersections on the edge of the map are special places where
agents may appear or disappear.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Turns</strong>: A turn connects one lane to another, via some intersection.
(Sidewalks are bidirectional, so specifying the intersection is necessary to
distinguish crosswalks at each end of a sidewalk.)</li>
<li><strong>Buildings</strong>: A building has a position, OSM metadata, and a <strong>front path</strong>
connecting the edge of the building to the nearest sidewalk. Most trips in A/B
Street begin and end at buildings. Some buildings also contain a number of
off-street parking spots.</li>
<li><strong>Area</strong>: An area has geometry and OSM metadata and represents a body of
water, forest, park, etc. They're just used for drawing.</li>
<li><strong>Bus stop</strong>: A bus stop is placed some distance along a sidewalk, with a
pointer to the position on the adjacent driving or bus lane where a bus stops
for pick-up.</li>
<li><strong>Bus route</strong>: A bus route has a name and a list of stops that buses will
cycle between. In the future, they'll include information about the
frequency/schedule of the route.</li>
<li><strong>Parking lot</strong>: A parking lot is connected to a road, has a shape, and has
some internal driving &quot;aisles.&quot; The number and position of individual parking
spots is auto-generated.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#coordinate-system" id="coordinate-system">Coordinate system</a></h2>
<p>A/B Street converts (longitude, latitude) coordinates into a simpler form.</p>
<ul>
<li>An (x, y) point starts with the top-left of the bounding polygon as the
origin. Note this is screen drawing order, not a Cartesian plane (with Y
increasing upwards) -- so angle calculations account for this.</li>
<li>The (x, y) values are f64's trimmed to a few decimal places, with way more
precision than is really needed. These might become actual fixed-point
integers later, but for now, a <code>Pt2D</code> skirts around Rust's limits on f64's by
guaranteeing no NaN's or infinities and thus providing the full <code>Eq</code> trait.</li>
<li>A few places in map conversion compare points using different thresholds,
usually below 1 meter. Ideally these epsilon comparisons could be eliminated
in favor of a fixed-point integer representation, but for now, explicit
thresholds are useful.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#invariants" id="invariants">Invariants</a></h2>
<p>Ideally, the finalized maps would satisfy a list of invariants, simplifying the
traffic simulation and drawing code built on top. But the input data is quite
messy and for now, most of these aren't quite guaranteed to be true.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some minimum length for lanes and turns. Very small lanes can't be drawn, tend
to break intersection polygons, and may lead to gridlocked traffic.</li>
<li>Some guarantees that positions along adjacent lanes actually match up, even
though different lanes on the same road may have different lengths. Examples
include the position of a bus stop on the sidewalk and bus lane matching up.
<ul>
<li>Additionally, parking lanes without an adjacent driving lane or bus stops
without any driving or bus lanes make no sense and should never occur.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Connectivity -- any sidewalk should be reachable from any other, and most
driving lanes should be accessible from any others. There are exceptions due
to border intersections -- if a car spawns on a highway along the border of
the map, it may be forced to disappear on the opposite border of the map, if
the highway happens to not have any exits within the map boundary.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#connectivity" id="connectivity">Connectivity</a></h2>
<p>For a single mode, each lane is connected to two intersections. Turns connect
two lanes. There are no turns between sidewalks and driving/bike/bus lanes.</p>
<p>All buildings and parking lots have driveways. This must connect to a sidewalk,
allowing pedestrians to enter/exit that object. The driveway OPTIONALLY
connects to the nearest driveable lane. This allows cars to enter/exit that
object for parking.</p>
<p>Public transit stops are located somewhere on a sidewalk. They're associated
with a driveable position where the bus or train stops. In the future, this
will need to account for dedicated surface-level platforms and for underground
transit stations, likely associated with a building.</p>
<p>There's a concept of &quot;parking blackholes.&quot; If you treat every road as
bidirectional without access restrictions, then the graph is connected. But the
more detailed view has to factor in one-way roads and things near the map
border. These blackholes influence where cars will try to look for parking
(since we don't want them entering a blackhole and getting stuck) and also, for
temporary/unintentional reasons, where pedestrian&lt;-&gt;bicycle transitions will
happen.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#importing" id="importing">Importing</a></h1>
<p>Overview of the process. The importer tool.</p>
<p>Don't be afraid of how complicated this seems. It started simple -- just bring
in OSM roads, chop into pieces, generate turns.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#from-osm-to-rawmap-convert_osm-crate" id="from-osm-to-rawmap-convert_osm-crate">From OSM to RawMap (<code>convert_osm</code> crate)</a></h1>
<p>The first phase of map building reads in data from OSM files and a few others,
producing a serialized <code>RawMap</code>. Importing all maps (one for each pre-defined
bounding polygon) takes a few minutes. Players don't see this cost; it only
takes a few seconds to load a serialized map.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>osm.rs</code>: Read .osm, extracting the points for road-like ways, buildings, and
areas
<ul>
<li>Areas usually come from a relation of multiple ways, with the points out of
order. Gluing all the points together fails when the .osm has some ways
clipped out. In that case, try to trace along the map boundary if the
partial area intersects the boundary in a clear way. Otherwise, just use a
straight line to try to close off the polygon.</li>
<li>Also read traffic signal locations and turn restrictions between OSM ways</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>split_ways.rs</code>: Split OSM ways into road segments
<ul>
<li>OSM ways cross many intersections, so treat points with multiple ways and
the points at the beginning and end of a way as intersections, then split
the way into road segments between two intersections.</li>
<li>This phase remembers which road segment is the beginning and end of the OSM
way, for per-lane turn restrictions later</li>
<li>Apply turn restrictions between roads here. Since OSM ways cross many
intersections, the turn restrictions only apply to one particular road
segment that gets created from the way. Make sure the destination of the
restriction is actually incident to a particular source road.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>clip.rs</code>: Clip the map to the boundary polygon
<ul>
<li>Osmosis options in <code>import.sh</code> preserve ways that cross the boundary</li>
<li>Trim roads that cross the boundary. There may be cases where a road dips out
of bounds, then immediately comes back in. Disconnecting it isn't ideal, but
it's better to manually tune the boundary polygon when this happens than try
to preserve lots of out-of-bounds geometry.</li>
<li>Area polygons are intersected with the boundary polygon using the <code>clipping</code>
crate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>lib.rs</code>: Remove cul-de-sacs (roads that begin and end at the same
intersection), because they mess up parking hints and pathfinding.</li>
<li><code>lib.rs</code>: Apply parking hints from a King County GIS blockface dataset
<ul>
<li>Match each blockface to the nearest edge of a road</li>
<li>Interpret the metadata to assign on-street parking there or not</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>lib.rs</code>: Apply offstreet parking hints from a King County GIS dataset
<ul>
<li>Match each point to the building containing it, plumbing through the number
of spots</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>lib.rs</code>: <strong>Disabled</strong>: Apply sidewalk presence hints from a King County GIS
dataset
<ul>
<li>Match each sidewalk line to the nearest edge of a road</li>
<li>Update the road to have a sidewalk on none, one, or both sides</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>lib.rs</code> using the <code>srtm</code> module: Load (extremely poor quality) elevation data</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="header" href="#roadintersection-geometry-rawmap-to-initialmap" id="roadintersection-geometry-rawmap-to-initialmap">Road/intersection geometry: RawMap to InitialMap</a></h1>
<p>The remainder of map construction is done in the <code>map_model</code> crate. There's one
intermediate structure between <code>RawMap</code> and <code>Map</code>, called <code>InitialMap</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>make/remove_disconnected.rs</code>: Remove disconnected roads
<ul>
<li>Just floodfill from some road, assuming all roads are bidirectional, to get
different partitions.</li>
<li>Remove roads from all but the largest partition</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>make/initial/mod.rs</code> and <code>make/initial/lane_specs.rs</code>: Interpret OSM tags to
figure out what lanes are on each side of each road, also figuring out the
total width of the road.</li>
<li><code>make/initial/geometry.rs</code>: Figure out the polygon for each intersection, and
trim back road center-lines to end at a face of the polygon.
<ul>
<li>For every road touching the intersection, get the polyline of each side,
based on the road's width
<ul>
<li>See appendix for how to shift polylines</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sort all the polylines by the angle to the intersection's shared point</li>
<li>Intersect every polyline with every other polyline
<ul>
<li>More specifically -- the second half of each polyline, to get the correct
collision point</li>
<li>Look at the perpendicular infinite line to the collision point on the
shifted polyline, then find where it hits the original center line. Trim
back the center line by the max distance from these collisions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Compute the intersection's polygon by considering collisions between
adjacent roads' polylines</li>
<li>Deal with short roads and floating point issues by deduping any adjacent
points closer than 0.1m</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="header" href="#initialmap-to-map" id="initialmap-to-map">InitialMap to Map</a></h1>
<p>Still in the <code>map_model</code> crate.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>map.rs</code>'s <code>make_half_map</code>: Expand roads to lanes, using the list of lane
types from before</li>
<li><code>make/turns.rs</code>: Generate turns for every intersection.
<ul>
<li>Vehicle turns (for cars, bikes, buses)
<ul>
<li>Consider every pair of roads in the intersection. Try to match up lane
types -- if there's a bike lane on both roads, don't add a turn from
driving-&gt;bike or bike-&gt;driving. If there's not, then fallback to
transitions between different lane types.</li>
<li>Classify the turn based on the difference between the angle of the
incoming lane's last line and the outgoing lane's first line

<li>A/B Street uses contraction hierarchies (CH) for fast routing, using the

<li><code>pathfind/vehicle.rs</code>: For cars, bikes, buses
<ul>
<li>There's a separate CH for cars, buses, and bikes, since they can use
slightly different sets of lanes.</li>
<li>Building the CH for buses and bikes is much faster than the one for cars,
because the algorithm can re-use the node ordering from the first CH.</li>
<li>Every lane is a node in the graph, even if it's not an appropriate lane
type -- it might change later, and reusing orderings is vital for speed.</li>
<li>If two lanes are connected by a turn, then there's an edge in the graph.

</li>
<li><code>pathfind/walking.rs</code>: For pedestrians

<li>All turns between two sidewalks become edges, again using length</li>
<li>When actually pathfinding, we get back a list of sidewalks. The actual

<li>This &quot;equivalent position on another lane&quot; process has a few weird cases,
since two lanes on the same road might have different lengths. Right now,
the same distance from the start of the lane is used, with clamping for

<h1><a class="header" href="#live-edits" id="live-edits">Live edits</a></h1>
<p>A key feature of A/B Street is the player editing the map and seeing how traffic
responds. The possible edits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change lane types (driving, bus, bike, parking -- sidewalks are fixed)</li>
<li>Change speed limits</li>
<li>Reverse a lane</li>
<li>Change a stop sign policy (which roads have a stop sign and which have
priority)</li>
<li>Change a traffic signal policy</li>
</ul>
<p>The map conversion process outlined above takes a few minutes, so reusing this
process directly to compute a map with edits wouldn't work at all for real
gameplay. Instead, the process for applying edits is incremental:</p>
<ul>
<li>Figure out the actual diff between edits and the current map
<ul>
<li>This is necessary for correctness, but also speeds up a sequence of edits
made in the UI -- only one or two lanes or intersections actually changes
each time. Of course when loading some saved edits, lots of things might
change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For any changed roads, make sure any bus stop on it have a good pointer to
their equivalent driving position for the bus.</li>
<li>For any modified intersections, recompute turns and the default intersection
policies</li>
<li>Recompute all the CHs for cars, buses, and bikes -- note sidewalks and bus
stops never change
<ul>
<li>This is the slowest step. Critically, the <code>fast_paths</code> crate lets a previous
node ordering be reused. If just a few edge weights change, then recomputing
is much faster than starting from scratch.</li>
<li>While making edits in the UI, we don't actually need to recompute the CH
after every little tweak. When the player exits edit mode, only then do we
recompute everything.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A list of lanes and intersections actually modified is then returned to the
drawing layer, which uploads new geometry to the GPU accordingly.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#development-tricks" id="development-tricks">Development tricks</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>Separate phases for fast incremental development
<ul>
<li>Don't reimport all data from OSM every time there's a change to part of the
map construction code!</li>
<li>For slow steps that don't change often, make them separate binaries -- hence
<code>convert_osm</code> being separate from the rest.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't be afraid of manual intervention
<ul>
<li>The data isn't perfect. It's easy to spend lots of time fiddling with code
to automatically handle all problems</li>
<li>Instead of automatically resolving problems, prefer good tooling for finding
and specifying fixes</li>
<li>Be careful of derivative structures that could get out of sync with OSM.
Prefer contributing real fixes to OSM.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Screenshot diff testing
<ul>
<li>When working on the code for intersection geometry, it's easy to check a few
example cases get fixed by some change. But what if another part of the map
regresses somehow?</li>
<li>Take screenshots of the entire map, keep the checksums under version
control, look at the diffs visually, and manually verify any changes.</li>
<li>Implementation details: One huge gif or png is too slow to read and write,
so take a bunch of tiled screenshots covering everything. Amusingly,
rendering to a file with <code>glium</code> is slow unless compiling in release mode
(which isn't an option for quick incremental development). So instead, pan
to each section of the map, render it, call an external screenshot utility,
and move on -- just don't wiggle the mouse during this process!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Different IDs for objects make sense during different phases
<ul>
<li>For the final product, lanes and such are just a contiguous array, indexed
by numeric IDs.</li>
<li>But sometimes, we need IDs that're the same between different boundary
polygons of maps, so that player edits can be applied anywhere. Using
(longitude, latitude) pairs hits floating-point serialization and comparison
issues, so referring to roads as (OSM way ID, OSM node ID 1, OSM node ID 2)
works instead.</li>

<h1><a class="header" href="#ab-streets-traffic-simulation" id="ab-streets-traffic-simulation">A/B Street's Traffic Simulation</a></h1>
<p>This article describes how cars, bikes, buses, and pedestrians are modeled in
A/B Street. All code lives in the <code>sim</code> crate.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/chYd5I-5oyc?t=1086">This recorded presentation</a> covers some of
this.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#discrete-event-simulation" id="discrete-event-simulation">Discrete-event simulation</a></h1>
<p>The traffic simulation models different agents (cars, bikes, buses, pedestrians,
and intersections) over time. Agents don't constantly sense and react to the
world every second; instead, they remain in some state until something
interesting happens. This is a discrete-event architecture -- events are
scheduled for some time in the future, and handling them changes the state of
some agents. The core simulation loop simply processes events in order -- see
<code>scheduler.rs</code> and the <code>step</code> method in <code>sim.rs</code>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#cars" id="cars">Cars</a></h2>
<p>(Note: Cars, bikes, and buses are all modeled the same way -- bikes just have a
max speed, and buses/bikes can use restricted lanes.)</p>
<p>Cars move through a sequence of lanes and turns (movements through an
intersection). They queue and can't over-take a slow lead vehicle. The main
simplifying assumption in A/B Street is that cars can instantly accelerate and
decelerate. This wouldn't model highway driving at all, where things like jam
waves are important, but it's reasonable for in-city driving. The essence of
scarcity is the capacity on lanes and the contention at intersections. What
happens in between isn't vital to get exactly right.</p>
<p>A car has a few states (<code>mechanics/car.rs</code>):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crossing</strong> some distance of a lane/turn over some time interval</li>
<li><strong>Queued</strong> behind another car on a lane/turn</li>
<li><strong>WaitingToAdvance</strong> at the end of a lane, blocked on an intersection</li>
<li>A few states where the car stays in one place: <strong>Parking</strong>, <strong>Unparking</strong>, and
<strong>Idling</strong> (for buses at a stop)</li>
</ul>
<p>State transitions happen in <code>mechanics/driving.rs</code>. This is best explained by an
example sequence:</p>
<ul>
<li>A car enters the Unparking state, taking a fixed 30s to exit a parking spot
and enter the adjacent driving lane. The driving lane is blocked during this
time, to mimic somebody pulling out from a parallel parking spot.</li>
<li>The car is now fully somewhere on the driving lane. It enters the Crossing
state, covering the remaining distance to the end of the road. The time
interval is calculated assuming the car travels at the max speed limit of the
road.</li>
<li>After that time, the car checks if there's anybody in the queue before it.
Nope? Then it attempts to initiate a turn through the intersection, but the
stop sign says no, so the car enters the WaitingToAdvance state.</li>
<li>Some time later, the stop sign wakes up the car. The car starts the turn,
entering the Crossing state again.</li>
<li>After finishing the turn, the car starts Crossing the next lane. When it's
finished, it turns out there are a few cars ahead of it, so it enters the
Queued state.</li>
<li>When the lead vehicle directly in front of the car exits the lane, it wakes up
the car, putting it in the Crossing state, starting at the appropriate
following distance behind the lead vehicle. This prevents the car from
immediately warping to the end of the lane when the lead vehicle is out of the
way.</li>
<li>And so on...</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="header" href="#exact-positions" id="exact-positions">Exact positions</a></h3>
<p>For a discrete-event simulation, we don't usually care exactly where on a lane a
car is at some time. But we do need to know for drawing and for a few cases
during simulation, such as determining when a bus is lined up with a bus stop in
the middle of a lane. <code>mechanics/queue.rs</code> handles this, computing the distance
of every car in a lane. For cars in the <code>Crossing</code> state, we linearly
interpolate distance based on the current time. Of course, cars have to remain
in order, so Queued cars are limited by the lead vehicle's position + the lead
vehicle's length + a fixed following distance of 1m.</p>
<p>Another case where we need to know exact positions of cars is to prevent the
first vehicle on a lane from hitting the back of a car who just left the lane.
All vehicles have length, and position is tracked by the front of the car. When
a car's front leaves a lane, its back is still partly in the lane. Logically,
the new lead car in the lane still needs to act like it's Queued. So each lane
keeps a &quot;laggy head&quot;, pointing to the car with its back partly in the lane.
After the laggy head has made it sufficient distance along its new turn or lane,
the laggy head on the old lane can be erased, unblocking the lead vehicle. This
requires calculating exact distances and some occasionally expensive cases where
we have to schedule frequent events to check when a laggy head is clear.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#lane-changing" id="lane-changing">Lane-changing</a></h2>
<p>Lane-changing (LCing) deserves special mention. A/B Street cheats by not
allowing it on lanes themselves. Instead, at intersections, cars can perform
turns that shift them over any number of lanes. These LCing turns conflict with
other turns appropriately, so the contention is still modeled. Why do it this
way? In a
<a href="http://apps.cs.utexas.edu/tech_reports/reports/tr/TR-2157.pdf">previous project</a>,
I tried opportunistic LCing. If a car had room to warp to the equivalent
distance on the adjacent lane without causing a crash, it would start LCing,
then take a fixed time to slide over, blocking both lanes throughout. This meant
cars often failed to LC when they needed to, forcing them to reroute, botching
their trip times. In many cases the cars would be permanently stuck, because
pathfinding would return paths requiring LCing that couldn't be pulled off in
practice due to really short roads. Why not try making the car slow down if
needed? Eventually it might have to stop, which could lead to unrealistic
gridlock. This LCing model was using a detailed discrete-time model with cars
accelerating properly; maybe it's easier with A/B Street's simplified movement
model.</p>
<p>Currently in A/B Street, cars will pick the least backed-up lane when there's a
choice. They make this decision once when they reach the front of a queue; look
for <code>opportunistically_lanechange</code> in <code>router.rs</code>. The decision could be
improved.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#pedestrians" id="pedestrians">Pedestrians</a></h2>
<p>Pedestrian modeling -- in <code>mechanics/walking.rs</code> is way simpler. Pedestrians
don't need to queue on sidewalks; they can &quot;ghost&quot; through each other. In
Seattle, there aren't huge crowds of people walking and slowing down, except for
niche cases like Pike Place Market. So in A/B Street, the only scarce resource
modeled is the time spent waiting to cross intersections.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#intersections" id="intersections">Intersections</a></h2>
<p>I need to flesh this section out. See <code>mechanics/intersections.rs</code> for how stop
signs and traffic signals work. Two things I need to fix before making this
section interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only wake up relevant agents when a previous agent finishes a turn.</li>
<li>Don't let an agent start a low-priority turn (like an unprotected left) if
it'll force a high-priority vehicle approaching to wait. The approaching
vehicle is still in the Crossing state, so we need to notify intersections
ahead of time of intended turns and an ETA.</li>
</ul>
<p>One contributor to permanent gridlock is cars and bikes being stuck in an
intersection, preventing conflicting turns from being performed. To help avoid
this, one of the last checks that stop signs and traffic signals perform before
accepting a new turn request is that the target lane has enough space for the
new vehicle. This is &quot;reserved&quot; space, not necessarily currently occupied by
vehicles in that lane. This accounts for other vehicles performing a turn bound
for that lane. See <code>try_to_reserve_entry</code> in <code>mechanics/queue.rs</code>. When a car
completely leaves a lane (determined by the &quot;laggy head&quot; described above), this
space is freed, and blocked cars are woken up.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#appendix-discrete-time-simulation" id="appendix-discrete-time-simulation">Appendix: discrete-time simulation</a></h2>
<p>A/B Street's first traffic model was discrete-time, meaning that every agent
reacted to the world every 0.1s. Cars had a more realistic kinematics model,
accelerating to change speed and gradually come to a halt. Cars did a worst-case
estimation of how far ahead they need to lookahead in order to satisfy different
constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't exceed any speed limits</li>
<li>Don't hit the lead vehicle (which might suddenly slam on its brakes)</li>
<li>Stop at the end of a lane, unless the intersection says to go</li>
</ul>
<p>After fighting with this approach for a long time, I eventually scrapped it in
favor of the simpler discrete-event model because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's fundamentally slow; there's lots of busy work where cars in freeflow with
nothing blocking them or stopped in a long queue constantly check to see if
anything has changed.</li>
<li>Figuring out the acceleration to apply for the next 0.1s in order to satisfy
all of the constraints is really complicated. Floating point inaccuracies
cause ugly edge cases with speeds that wind up slightly negative and with cars
coming to a complete stop slightly past the end of a lane. I wound up storing
the &quot;intent&quot; of an action to auto-correct these errors.</li>
<li>The realism of having cars accelerate smoothly didn't add value to the core
idea in A/B Street, which is to model points of contention like parking
capacity and intersections. (This is the same reason why I don't model bike
racks for parking bikes -- in Seattle, it's never hard to find something to
lock to -- this would be very different if Copenhagen was the target.)
Additionally, the kinematics model made silly assumptions about driving anyway
-- cars would smash on their accelerators and brakes as hard as possible
within all of the constraints.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="header" href="#travel-demand" id="travel-demand">Travel demand</a></h1>
<p>A/B Street simulates people following a schedule of trips over a day. A single
<em>trip</em> has a start and endpoint, a departure time, and a mode. Most trips go
between buildings, but the start or endpoint may also be a border intersection
to represent something outside the map boundaries. The mode specifies whether
the person will walk, bike, drive, or use transit. Without a good set of people
and trips, evaluating some changes to a map is hard -- what if the traffic
patterns near the change aren't realistic to begin with? This chapter describes
where the travel demand data comes from.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#scenarios" id="scenarios">Scenarios</a></h2>

<h3><a class="header" href="#proletariat-robot" id="proletariat-robot">Proletariat robot</a></h3>
<p>What if we just want to generate a reasonable model without any city-specific
data? One of the simplest approaches is just to spawn people beginning at
residential buildings, make them go to some workplace in the morning, then
return in the evening. OpenStreetMap building tags can be used to roughly
classify building types and distinguish small houses from large apartments. See
the <code>proletariat_robot</code>
<a href="https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/blob/master/sim/src/make/activity_model.rs">code</a>
for an implementation of this.</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/issues/154">ongoing</a> work
spearheaded by Mateusz. Some of the ideas for next steps are to generate
different types of people (students, workers), give them a set of activities
with durations (go to school for 7 hours, 1 hour lunch break), and then further
pick specfic buildings to travel to using more OSM tags.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#modifying-demand" id="modifying-demand">Modifying demand</a></h2>
<p>The travel demand model is extremely fixed; the main effect of a different
random number seed is currently to initially place parked cars in specific
spots. When the player makes changes to the map, exactly the same people and
trips are simulated, and we just measure how trip time changes. This is a very
short-term prediction. If it becomes much more convenient to bike or bus
somewhere, then more people will do it over time. How can we transform the
original demand model to respond to these changes?</p>
<p>Right now, there's very preliminary work in sandbox mode for Seattle weekday
scenarios. You can cancel all trips for some people (simulating lockdown) or
modify the mode for some people (change 50% of all driving trips between 7 and
9am to use transit).</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#gridlock" id="gridlock">Gridlock</a></h1>
<p>Here &quot;gridlock&quot; refers to the general problem of trips getting permanently
stuck, preventing the full simulation from completing. Most of the work is
tracked <a href="https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/issues/114">here</a>.</p>
<p>My general approach right now to get a map working is to cancel some percent of
all trips, look for individual problems, fix them, and repeat. Once the full day
works, cancel less trips. It's easier to isolate the root cause of problems when
there are less of them erupting simultaneously.</p>
<p>The general lesson is: you can't code your way around all edge cases. The data
in OSM often needs manual fixes. It's often useful to spend coding effort on
tools to detect and fix OSM problems.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#problems" id="problems">Problems</a></h2>
<p>The choices in the movement model matter. Some gridlock is inherent to any
system with queueing and conflicting turns. But in reality, people wiggle around
partly blocked turns. And some of this comes from the treatment of the
front/back of vehicles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Short roads in OSM causing very weird geometry</li>
<li>Intersection geometry being too large, requiring too much time to cross</li>
<li>Unrealistic traffic patterns caused by everyone trying to park in one big
garage (downtown) or take some alley (the UW soundcast issue)</li>
<li>Too many people try to take an unprotected left turn (often at a stop sign)</li>
<li>Bad individual traffic signals, usually at 5- or 6-ways</li>
<li>Groups of traffic signals logically acting as a single intersection</li>
<li>Separate traffic signals along a corridor being unsynchronized</li>
<li>Vehicles performing illegal sequences of turns</li>
<li>Vehicles are stuck with their plan and not reacting to traffic by changing
route</li>
<li>Real traffic would result in a gridlock without a deliberate actions to avoid
it. Such actions range from individual decisions of drivers to police manually
controlling traffic. Intelligent avoidance of gridlock is not simulated and is
extremely hard to simulate.</li>
<li>Vehicles will wait in lane filled with already waiting vehicles, even if there
is a completely empty lane allowing travel in desired direction. It makes
easier for entire lane between crossings to fill, contributing to gridlocks.
Note that while this and other clearly stupid behaviors are clearly
unrealistic, it is not trivial to implement more realistic and more efficient
decisions.</li>
<li>Issues caused by the unrealistic
<a href="https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/blob/master/docs/articles/trafficsim/article.md#lane-changing">lane-changing model</a>
<ul>

second group will wait for the first to completely clear the intersection.

<h1><a class="header" href="#lake-washington-blvd-stay-healthy-street" id="lake-washington-blvd-stay-healthy-street">Lake Washington Blvd Stay Healthy Street</a></h1>
<p><em>Draft, updated May 7, 2020 by Dustin Carlino (<a href="mailto:case_studies/dabreegster@gmail.com">dabreegster@gmail.com</a>)</em></p>
<p>In April 2020, Seattle Department of Transportation started rolling out
<a href="https://sdotblog.seattle.gov/2020/04/16/announcing-stay-healthy-streets/">Stay Healthy Streets</a>,
restricting roads to through-traffic to give people walking and biking more
space for social distancing.
<a href="http://seattlegreenways.org/socialdistancingstreets/">Seattle Neighborhood Greenways</a>
soon proposed extending this to a
<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HQMnagRf8EbS1nouqCMLl4LZr0QE8VrC&amp;usp=sharing">130-mile network</a>.</p>
<p>Selecting the streets requires some planning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These streets were selected to amplify outdoor exercise opportunities for
areas with limited open space options, low car ownership and routes connecting
people to essential services and food take out. We also ensured street
closures did not impact newly opened food pick up loading zones, parking
around hospitals for service for health care professionals, and bus routes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've spent the last two years building <a href="https://abstreet.org">A/B Street</a>,
software to explore the impacts of changes like this on different modes of
transportation. So, let's try implementing part of the proposed network and see
what happens!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> You might want to read <a href="https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/blob/master/old_docs/how_it_works.md">how A/B Street
works</a>
first.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a class="header" href="#lake-washington-blvd" id="lake-washington-blvd">Lake Washington Blvd</a></h2>
<p>Let's start with one part of the proposal, closing Lake Washington Blvd to cars
through the Arboretum. There's already a multi-use trail alongside this stretch,
but its width makes it difficult to maintain 6 feet from people. There are some
parking lots that become inaccessible with this proposal, but they're currently
closed anyway.</p>
<p><img src="case_studies/edits.gif" alt="edits" /></p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#first-attempt" id="first-attempt">First attempt</a></h3>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PU0iT-_3-es" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Let's get started! If you want to follow along, <a href="https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/blob/master/old_docs/INSTRUCTIONS.md">install A/B
Street</a>,
open sandbox mode, and switch the map to Lake Washington corridor. Zoom in on
the southern tip of the Arboretum and hop into edit mode. We can see Lake
Washington Blvd just has one travel lane in each direction here. Click each
lane, convert it to a bike lane, and repeat north until Foster Island Road.</p>
<p>When we leave edit mode, the traffic simulation resets to midnight. Nothing
really interesting happens until 5 or 6am, so we'll speed up time. Watching the
section of road we edited, we'll only see pedestrians and bikes use this stretch
of road. If we want, we can click an individual person and follow along their
journey.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LSCHeDi5484" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Something's weird though. There's lots of traffic cutting northbound through the
neighborhood, along 29th, Ward, and 28th. We can open up the throughput layer to
find which roads have the most traffic. More usefully, we can select &quot;compare
before edits&quot; to see what roads are getting more or less traffic because of the
road we modified. As expected, there's much less traffic along Lake Wash Blvd,
but it's also clear that lots of cars are now cutting through 26th Ave E.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#traffic-calming" id="traffic-calming">Traffic calming</a></h3>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qAf5IAMbpcU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Let's say you want to nudge traffic to use 23rd Ave, the nearest north/south
arterial, instead. (A/B Street is an unopinionated tool; if you have a different
goal in mind, try using it for that instead.) In this simulation, drivers pick
the fastest route, so we could try lowering speed limits or make some of the
residential streets connecting to Madison one-way, discouraging through-traffic.
In reality, the speed limit changes could be implemented through
<a href="https://streetsillustrated.seattle.gov/design-standards/trafficcalming/">traffic calming</a>
or cheap, temporary alternatives.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#next-steps" id="next-steps">Next steps</a></h2>
<p>I'm working to model &quot;local access only&quot; roads in A/B Street, and I'll describe
how to measure the impact on travel times. Stay tuned to see more of the
<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HQMnagRf8EbS1nouqCMLl4LZr0QE8VrC&amp;usp=sharing">proposed network</a>
simulated, and get in touch if you'd like to help out!</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#west-seattle-mitigations" id="west-seattle-mitigations">West Seattle mitigations</a></h1>
<p><em>Draft, updated June 23, 2020 by Dustin Carlino (<a href="mailto:case_studies/dabreegster@gmail.com">dabreegster@gmail.com</a>)</em></p>
<p>In March 2020, the West Seattle bridge was closed due to cracks forming. As of
May, COVID-19's impact on commuting means the area still hasn't seen how the
area will handle losing the main route to the rest of Seattle. A local group,
HPAC, published a list of
<a href="https://www.westsideseattle.com/robinson-papers/2020/05/04/highland-park-action-coalition-calls-seattle-officials-traffic">requests to SDOT</a>
to prepare the area for these changes.</p>
<p>This page will try to explore some of the problems and solutions from HPAC's
document using <a href="https://abstreet.org">A/B Street</a>, a traffic simulator designed
to explore the impacts of changes like this on different modes of
transportation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> You might want to read <a href="https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/blob/master/old_docs/how_it_works.md">how A/B Street
works</a>
first.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a class="header" href="#16th-ave-sw-and-sw-holden-st" id="16th-ave-sw-and-sw-holden-st">16th Ave SW and SW Holden St</a></h2>
<p>HPAC has been asking for a protected left-turn phase at this intersection. I'm
unfamiliar with this intersection and currently unable to scout in-person, so
I'm blindly guessing the traffic signal currently has just two phases:</p>
<p><img src="case_studies/existing_diagram.gif" alt="existing_diagram" /></p>
<p>From watching the traffic, it seems like the east/west direction is busier, with
lots of eastbound traffic headed towards WA-509. Holden St has no turn lanes, so
a protected left turn phase makes sense. Let's make the change and see what
happens:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6tooJaZLa0Q" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Unfortuately, we can't evaluate the change yet, because the simulation gets
stuck with unrealistic traffic jams in other parts of the map. This is mostly
due to data quality issues in OpenStreetMap and incorrectly guessed traffic
signal timings. These problems can be fixed with the help of somebody familiar
with the area.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#re-evaluate-arterials" id="re-evaluate-arterials">Re-evaluate arterials</a></h2>
<p>The 9th item from HPAC's list asks for measuring the amount of east-west traffic
to figure out what streets people are using as arterials. That's an easy
analysis, using the <em>throughput</em> layer.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yzp9c7gHhOI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>By 6am, the busiest streets include Admiral Way, S Charlestown, SW Genesee, SW
Alaska, SW Holden, and SW Roxbury St. Again, it's necessary to first fix data
quality problems and run a full day before doing more analysis.</p>
<p>Once the simulation is running smoothly, A/B Street can be used to make changes
-- like lowering speed limits, adding a protected left turn phase, or converting
part of the road into a bus lane -- and evaluate the effects on individual trips
and aggregate groups.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#repair-the-bridge" id="repair-the-bridge">Repair the bridge</a></h2>
<p>Community proposals now includes a &quot;repair the bridge&quot; option, which should
restore things to how they were before March 2020. This is useful as a baseline,
to explore what traffic patterns were like before the closure.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#contributing-for-non-programmers" id="contributing-for-non-programmers">Contributing for non-programmers</a></h2>

</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#long-term-vision" id="long-term-vision">Long-term vision</a></h2>
<p>Longer term, I'd like to take lots of the work in generating and interacting
with high-detail OpenStreetMap-based maps and generalize it, possibly as a new
OSM viewer/editor.</p>
<p>More generally, I'd like to see how simulation can help individuals understand
and explore other policy decisions related to cities. Domains I'm vaguely
interested in, but not at all knowledgable about, include land-use / zoning,
housing, and supply chains. In late March 2020, a new collaborator started a
pandemic model using the existing simulation of people occupying shared spaces.
What are other domains could benefit from the rich agent-based model we're
building?</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#project-motivations" id="project-motivations">Project motivations</a></h1>
<p>I thought it'd be helpful to explain what motivates my work in A/B Street. These
are just my personal values; I don't intend to make a careful argument about
these here. In no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Transparency and reproducibility</strong>: if city government uses data, modeling,
or simulation to inform a decision affecting the general public, then anybody
ought to be able to repeat that analysis.</p>
<ul>
<li>This means code and data should be open.</li>
<li>Businesses like <a href="https://replicahq.com/">Sidewalk Lab's Replica</a> and
<a href="https://www.remix.com/solutions/streets">Remix</a> still need to generate
income, but it's unclear why governments use taxes to pay for something only
they see.</li>
<li>Decision making should be documented clearly. Why were the
<a href="https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/maintenance-and-paving/current-paving-projects/35th-ave-ne">35th Ave bike lanes</a>
scrapped? Was the amount of on-street parking on nearby residential roads
factored in? Was there analysis of how trip time is impacted by parking in
the neighborhood and walking a few blocks to a business on the arterial?</li>
<li>I'm personally inspired by approaches like
<a href="https://info.vtaiwan.tw/">vTaiwan</a> and
<a href="https://po.pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/opengov/">PDIS</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accessibility leads to participation</strong>: There's overhead to taking small
ideas to advocacy groups or inconveniently timed public meetings. If the
planning process is easier to interact with, more people will participate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Seattle's
<a href="https://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/programs-and-services/your-voice-your-choice">Your Voice, Your Choice</a>
program is maybe an example of this</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Short-term changes</strong>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_Transit_3">ST3</a>
is exciting, but 2040 isn't close. There are much cheaper changes that can be
implemented sooner.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of the edits in A/B Street are inspired by tactical urbanism; they
could be prototyped with signs and paint.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The US is too dependent on cars</strong>: This has an unacceptable impact on the
environment. Even ignoring that, many cities are out of room to build more
roads. We can't keep scaling population like this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Autonomous vehicles will NOT save the day</strong>: They can squeeze more
throughput out of existing infrastructure, but only up to a point. They might
encourage people to move and tolerate longer commutes. Mass transit and dense
land-use patterns handle population growth better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compromise and trade-offs</strong>: I see lots of rhetoric calling for extreme,
sudden change. I don't want to ban all cars from downtown Seattle, because
that's not realistic. I want to focus on immediate steps forward. I want to
come up with estimates about impacting drivers by a median 3 minutes in order
to save a bus route 1 minute, and to shift public discourse towards that.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1><a class="header" href="#backstory" id="backstory">Backstory</a></h1>
<p>I originally wanted to tell a much longer story here of how I came to work on
A/B Street, but I'm not sure this is the right time yet. So consider this the
quick version.</p>
<p>I grew up in Baton Rouge, where driving is effectively the only mode of
transport. (I've gone back and made a point of taking long walks to confirm how
antagonistically the city is designed towards walking.) Very early on, I fell in
love with a Nintendo 64 game called Banjo Kazooie, which led me to the online
fan communities of the early 2000's. I wanted to create games too, so I started
learning programming via library books and lots of questions on IRC. Because I
never had any confidence in art, I wound up working on
<a href="https://github.com/dabreegster/mnemonicrl/">roguelikes</a>, which led to a fervent
interest in pathfinding algorithms and
<a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/%7Eralex/papers/PDF/OOPSLA06antiobjects.pdf">collaborative diffusion</a>.
When I started driving in high school, I quickly realized how bad people were at
it. I remember being stuck at the intersection of
<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1279204989">Florida Blvd and Cloud</a> and
first wondering if the pathfinding algorithms could help with traffic. Can you
see where this is going?</p>
<p><img src="project/history/cloud_florida.jpg" alt="Impatience is a virtue" /></p>
<p>I moved to Austin for college. One of the first days of class, I shuffled down
the stairs of Gearing Hall past a crackly old speaker apocalyptically announcing
the weather forecast (details add color, right?) into a seminar demanding a
totally open-ended first assignment to do something interesting. After I left,
somebody stopped to ask me for directions, but I didn't know campus well yet. I
thought about how Google Maps gave really silly walking directions. So I decided
I'd hand-draw a map of campus, showing all of the construction, how to cut
through the labryinth that is Welch Hall on hot days, and where to find the 24/7
robot coffee machines, and hack together a routing engine to help people find
the shortest path between their classes. The feedback I got on this assignment
included something along the lines of, &quot;I was really pretty impressed first that
you would be so stupid as to actually try to do this...&quot;</p>
<p><img src="project/history/ut_map.png" alt="Hand-mapping UT Austin" /></p>
<p>But I did, and that led me to discovering OpenStreetMap, which it turns out was
pretty pivotal. (The first version of my campus map was seeded vaguely off an
official paper map, but mostly I walked around and invented half-assed surveying
methods on the spot.) Next semester, I joined a freshman research stream with
somebody who had worked on <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/%7Eaim/">AIM</a>, UT's
demonstration that autonomous vehicles wouldn't need traffic lights. Everything
came together, and I started a 3 year journey of building
<a href="https://github.com/dabreegster/aorta/">AORTA</a>, a traffic simulator for AVs.
Guided by the research lab, I explored the really bizarre idea of letting AVs
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/%7Eaim/papers/ITSC13-dcarlino.pdf">bid to turn lights green sooner</a>
and micro-tolling all roads to disincentivize congestion. Both of these
mechanisms would be incredibly unfair to people without the spare cash to back
up their high value-of-time, but I brushed this off by saying the currency could
be based on carpooling, EVs, etc.</p>
<p><img src="project/history/aorta.gif" alt="Approximately Orchestrated Routing and Transportation Analyzer" /></p>
<p>It was great to try research in college; I learned I <em>really</em> dislike munging
data and compressing my work into 6 pages of conference paper LaTeX. So I moved
to Seattle to work in industry instead, on something completely unrelated to
transportation. Lots of things began unravelling for me in Seattle, but one of
them was biking. In Austin, I had picked up mountain biking, and all but stopped
driving; it was an amazing place to explore and commute by bike. Seattle was
different. There were many more cyclists around, but the experience felt more
stressful, the drivers more aggressive. I had plenty of near-misses. I kept
commuting by bike, but the joy of it was gone. I started noticing how many cars
were parked on narrow arterials and wondering why that was a fair use of space.
I started paying attention to the public discourse around bike infrastructure in
Seattle and feeling like the conversation was... chaotic.</p>
<p><img src="project/history/manhattan.jpg" alt="Manhattan took walkability seriously" /></p>
<p>Fast forward to late 2017. This is where I'll omit chunks of the story. I
visited London, my first experience with a city that took public transit
seriously. When I returned, lots of latent ideas stopped fermenting and started
exploding. I threw together a prototype of A/B Street and started the arduous
process at work of open-sourcing it and applying to a program to let me work it
on for a few quarters. A few months later, I wound up quitting instead, and
began to work on A/B Street in earnest.</p>
